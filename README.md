# Sage Insights Dashboard and Collector

## ANNOUNCEMENT

Due to performance issues, Sage no longer supports `csv` as an output file. All files must not be in the form of `parquet`.

Because of this change, a large number of columns had to be reworked to handle the additional of a true schema being saved with the parquet files.

In a decision to keep things easier to maintain in the future, column names have been reworked to use more of the natural naming conventions.

* Actions to take migrating >1.6 or higher (if previously installed).
  * Patch to v1.6 or higher
  * Patch/Update the local code-environment for Sage
  * Rebuild the new Streamlit Code-Studio Template
  * Rename both the original `partitioned_data` and `base_data` folders (if wanting to preserve historical data)
  * Run both `Init Dashboard` and `Init Worker` Macros
    * **NOTE** Disable checkbox for re-running the scenarios on Init
  * Double check that all code-environments properly rebuilt in the extra worker nodes

* DSS at a glance
* Individual objects, statistics, graphs
* Maintenance and performance reviews

## Tested Versions

1. v14.1.0
1. v14.0.0
1. v13.5.5
